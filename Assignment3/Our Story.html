      <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU BUY HANDMADE PRODUCTS OR HANDICRAFT ITEMS ONLINE?</h2>
     <p>  In this fast-paced world, originality is dying a slow death. Handcrafted pieces ensure the survival of this originality along with the survival of the ancient crafts that are woven into the fabric of India. As opposed to mass production of
      low-quality products, each piece at Folksy is handcrafted one at a time, slowly and patiently, resulting in a piece that is truly authentic and unique for you. Every piece possesses unique differences since variations in colour, design,
      patterns and shading are inherent properties of handmade items. No two handcrafted items are alike, which means that no one else in the world will possess the exact same piece as you. Breathe new life into your wardrobes and your lives with
      handmade apparels and handmade home decoration.
